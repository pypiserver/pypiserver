Files:
======

- ``bumpver.py``             : Bump, commit and tag new project versions
- ``check_readme.sh``        : Check that README has no RsT-syntactic errors.
- ``package.sh``             : Build deployable artifact (wheel) in ``/dist/`` folder.
- ``README.rst``             : This file.


Release check-list:
===================
1. Update ``/CHANGES.rst`` (+ Title + Date) & ``/README.rst`` (Date,
   not version).

2. Push to GitHub to run all TCs once more.

3. Bump version: commit & tag it with ``/bin/bumpver.py``.
   Use ``--help``.
   Read `PEP-440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`_ to decide the version.

4. Push it in GitHub with ``--follow-tags``.

5. Generate package *wheel* with ``/bin/package.sh``.

6. Upload to PyPi with ``twine upload -s -i <gpg-user> dist/*``

7. Ensure that the new tag is built on hub.docker.com as ``latest`` and as a
   direct tag reference.

8. Copy release notes from ``/CHANGES.rst`` in GitHub as new *"release"* page
   on the new tag.  Check syntactic differences between ``.md`` and ``.rst`` files.
