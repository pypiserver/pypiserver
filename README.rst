pypiserver is a minimal PyPI compatible server. It can be used to
serve a set of packages and eggs to easy_install or pip.

Installation and Usage/Quickstart
=================================
pypiserver will work with python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3. python
3.0 and 3.1 may also work, but pypiserver is not being tested with
these versions.

Run the following commands to get your PyPI server up and running::

  pip install pypiserver
  mkdir ~/packages
  # copy some source packages or eggs to this directory
  pypi-server -p 8080 ~/packages
  pip install -i http://localhost:8080/simple/ ...

Alternative Installation as standalone script
=============================================
The git repository contains a 'pypi-server-standalone.py' script,
which is a single python file ready to be executed without any other
dependencies.

Run the following commands to download the script with wget::

  wget https://raw.github.com/schmir/pypiserver/standalone/pypi-server-standalone.py
  chmod +x pypi-server-standalone.py

or with curl::

  curl -O https://raw.github.com/schmir/pypiserver/standalone/pypi-server-standalone.py
  chmod +x pypi-server-standalone.py

The server can then be started with::

  ./pypi-server-standalone.py

Feel free to rename the script and move it into your $PATH.

Running on heroku/dotcloud
=================================
https://github.com/dexterous/pypiserver-on-the-cloud contains
instructions on how to run pypiserver on one of the supported cloud
service providers.

Detailed Usage
=================================
pypi-server -h will print a detailed usage message::

  pypi-server [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES_DIRECTORY...]
    start PyPI compatible package server serving packages from
    PACKAGES_DIRECTORY. If PACKAGES_DIRECTORY is not given on the
    command line, it uses the default ~/packages.  pypiserver scans this
    directory recursively for packages. It skips packages and
    directories starting with a dot. Multiple package directories can be
    specified.

  pypi-server understands the following options:

    -p PORT, --port PORT
      listen on port PORT (default: 8080)

    -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
      listen on interface INTERFACE (default: 0.0.0.0, any interface)

    -P PASSWORD_FILE, --passwords PASSWORD_FILE
      use apache htpasswd file PASSWORD_FILE in order to enable password
      protected uploads.

    --disable-fallback
      disable redirect to real PyPI index for packages not found in the
      local index

    --fallback-url FALLBACK_URL
      for packages not found in the local index, this URL will be used to
      redirect to (default: http://pypi.python.org/simple)

    --server METHOD
      use METHOD to run the server. Valid values include paste,
      cherrypy, twisted, gunicorn, gevent, wsgiref, auto. The
      default is to use "auto" which chooses one of paste, cherrypy,
      twisted or wsgiref.

    -r PACKAGES_DIRECTORY, --root PACKAGES_DIRECTORY
      [deprecated] serve packages from PACKAGES_DIRECTORY

  pypi-server -h
  pypi-server --help
    show this help message

  pypi-server --version
    show pypi-server's version

  pypi-server -U [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES_DIRECTORY...]
    update packages in PACKAGES_DIRECTORY. This command searches
    pypi.python.org for updates and shows a pip command line which
    updates the package.

  The following additional options can be specified with -U:

    -x
      execute the pip commands instead of only showing them

    -d DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY
      download package updates to this directory. The default is to use
      the directory which contains the latest version of the package to
      be updated.

    -u
      allow updating to unstable version (alpha, beta, rc, dev versions)

  Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiserver for more information.



Configuring pip/easy_install
============================
Always specifying the the pypi url on the command line is a bit
cumbersome. Since pypi-server redirects pip/easy_install to the
pypi.python.org index if it doesn't have a requested package, it's a
good idea to configure them to always use your local pypi index.

pip
-----
For pip this can be done by setting the environment variable
PIP_INDEX_URL in your .bashrc/.profile/.zshrc::

  export PIP_INDEX_URL=http://localhost:8080/simple/

or by adding the following lines to ~/.pip/pip.conf::

  [global]
  index-url = http://localhost:8080/simple/

easy_install
------------
For easy_install it can be configured with the following setting in
~/.pydistutils.cfg::

  [easy_install]
  index_url = http://localhost:8080/simple/


Uploads via setup.py upload
===========================
Uploading packages via `python setup.py upload` is also
possible. First make sure you have the passlib module installed::

  pip install passlib

Then create a apache htpassword file with::

  htpasswd -sc .htaccess myusername

You'll be prompted for a password. You'll need to restart the server
with the -P option::

  pypi-server -p 8080 -P /path/to/.htaccess /path/to/private_pypi_folder/

Edit or create a ~/.pypirc file with the following content::

  [distutils]
  index-servers =
    pypi
    internal

  [pypi]
  username:pypiusername
  password:pypipasswd

  [internal]
  repository: http://127.0.0.1:8080
  username: myusername
  password: mypasswd

Uploading then works by running::

  python setup.py sdist upload -r internal


Managing the package directory
==============================
pypi-server's -U option makes it possible to search for updates of
available packages. It scans the package directory for available
packages and searches on pypi.python.org for updates. Without further
options 'pypi-server -U' will just print a list of commands which must
be run in order to get the latest version of each package. Output
looks like::

  checking 106 packages for newer version

  .........u.e...........e..u.............
  .....e..............................e...
  ..........................

  no releases found on pypi for PyXML, Pymacs, mercurial, setuptools

  # update raven from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4
  pip -q install --no-deps -i http://pypi.python.org/simple -d /home/ralf/packages/mirror raven==1.4.4

  # update greenlet from 0.3.3 to 0.3.4
  pip -q install --no-deps -i http://pypi.python.org/simple -d /home/ralf/packages/mirror greenlet==0.3.4

It first prints for each package a single character after checking the
available versions on pypi. A dot means the package is up-to-date, 'u'
means the package can be updated and 'e' means the list of releases on
pypi is empty. After that it show a pip command line which can be used
to update a one package. Either copy and paste that or run
"pypi-server -Ux" in order to really execute those commands. You need
to have pip installed for that to work however.

Specifying an additional '-u' option will also allow alpha, beta and
release candidates to be downloaded. Without this option these
releases won't be considered.


Optional dependencies
=====================
- pypiserver ships with it's own copy of bottle. It's possible to use
  bottle with different WSGI servers. pypiserver chooses any of the
  following paste, cherrypy, twisted, wsgiref (part of python) if
  available.
- pypiserver relies on the passlib module for parsing apache htpasswd
  files. You need to install it, when using the -P, --passwords
  option. The following command will do that::

    pip install passlib


Using a different WSGI server
=============================
If none of the above servers matches your needs, pypiserver also
exposes an API to get the internal WSGI app, which you can then run
under any WSGI server you like. pypiserver.app has the following
interface::

  def app(root=None,
	  redirect_to_fallback=True,
	  fallback_url="http://pypi.python.org/simple")

and returns the WSGI application. root is the package directory,
redirect_to_fallback specifies whether to redirect to fallback_url when
a package is missing.

gunicorn
----------------

The following command uses gunicorn to start pypiserver::

  gunicorn -w4 'pypiserver:app("/home/ralf/packages")'

or when using multiple roots::

  gunicorn -w4 'pypiserver:app(["/home/ralf/packages", "/home/ralf/experimental"])'


apache/mod_wsgi
----------------
In case you're using apache 2 with mod_wsgi, the following config file
(contributed by Thomas Waldmann) can be used::

  # An example pypiserver.wsgi for use with apache2 and mod_wsgi, edit as necessary.
  #
  # apache virtualhost configuration for mod_wsgi daemon mode:
  #    Alias /robots.txt /srv/yoursite/htdocs/robots.txt
  #    WSGIPassAuthorization On
  #    WSGIScriptAlias /     /srv/yoursite/cfg/pypiserver.wsgi
  #    WSGIDaemonProcess     pypisrv user=pypisrv group=pypisrv processes=1 threads=5 maximum-requests=500 umask=0007 display-name=wsgi-pypisrv inactivity-timeout=300
  #    WSGIProcessGroup      pypisrv

  PACKAGES = "/srv/yoursite/packages"
  HTPASSWD = "/srv/yoursite/htpasswd"
  import pypiserver
  application = pypiserver.app(PACKAGES, redirect_to_fallback=True, password_file=HTPASSWD)

paste/pastedeploy
----------------------
paste allows to run multiple WSGI applications under different URL
paths. Therefore it's possible to serve different set of packages on
different paths.

The following example `paste.ini` could be used to serve stable and
unstable packages on different paths::

  [composite:main]
  use = egg:Paste#urlmap
  /unstable/ = unstable
  / = stable

  [app:stable]
  use = egg:pypiserver#main
  root = ~/stable-packages

  [app:unstable]
  use = egg:pypiserver#main
  root = ~/stable-packages
	 ~/unstable-packages

  [server:main]
  use = egg:gunicorn#main
  host = 0.0.0.0
  port = 9000
  workers = 5
  accesslog = -

.. NOTE::

  You need to install some more dependencies for this to work,
  e.g. run::

    pip install paste pastedeploy gunicorn pypiserver

  The server can then be started with::

    gunicorn_paster paste.ini

  git clone https://github.com/schmir/pypiserver.git

to create a copy of the repository, then::

  git pull

inside the copy to receive the latest version.


Bugs
=============
pypiserver does not implement the full API as seen on PyPI_. It
implements just enough to make easy_install and pip install work.

The following limitations are known:

- pypiserver doesn't implement the XMLRPC interface: pip search
  will not work.
- pypiserver doesn't implement the json based '/pypi' interface. pyg_
  uses that and will not work.

Please use github's bugtracker
https://github.com/schmir/pypiserver/issues if you find any other
bugs.
