------------------

- ENH: The Dockerfile used for the official Docker images now uses Python 3.6
  rather than Python 2.7 (#284, thanks @etene!)
- ENH: The `welcome.html` page has been updated to provide more metadata
  and be more HTML-standards compliant (#283, thanks @maggyero!)
- FIX: the `pypi-server -U` command no longer fails when run inside the
  Docker container (thanks to @mkolb-navican for reporting in #264)
- FIX: The `remove_pkg` API action now removes any extant instances of a
  package name-version combination, not just the first one found. This means
  that now, for example, if a `.whl` and `.tar.gz` file exist for the
  requested package name and version, both will be removed (thanks to
  @esciara for reporting in #268)

  behind an apache webserver (#289, thanks @Helveg!)


1.3.1 (2019-09-10)
------------------

- FIX: previously, it was possible to upload packages with hashing algorithms
  other than md5, but downloading them again with pip was impossible due to
  incorrect truncation of the hash. This has been fixed! (Thanks
  @ArneBachmann for figuring out what was wrong and reporting the issue
  in #265).
- FIX: argument parsing would previously fail for the short form of
  ``--help``, due an incorrect operator used during comparison (thanks to
  @maggyero, #271)
- DOC: significant improvements to formatting and consistency in the README
  (thanks to @maggyero, #270)

1.3.0 (2019-05-05)
------------------

- ENH: pypiserver now consistently and correctly handles the `X-Forwarded-Host`
  header to allow for alternative base URLs (#248, resolves #155, thanks
  @kujyp for an excellent first-time contribution!)
- DOC: significantly more information added to the `docker-compose.yml`
  example, including recipes for various configuration options (thanks
  @jetheurer for pointing out the errors in the existing docs, #243!)
- DOC: removed outdated suggestion to serve the packages data directly via
  a webserver and replaced with information about setting up nginx
  caching (thanks @RiceKab for bringing the issue to our attention, #232)


1.2.7 (2019-01-31)
------------------

- FIX: bcrypt is now *properly* installed in the Docker image, and our
  automated tests now do a better job of making sure authentication and
  uploads work as expected in Docker (thanks @ronneke1996, #239; also
  thanks @kellycampbell, #235 for an alternate approach that wound up
  being unused but is still appreciated!)

1.2.6 (2019-01-26)
------------------

- SEC: mitigate potential CRLF injection attacks from malicious URLs
  (thanks @samwcyo, #237)

1.2.5 (2018-11-11)
------------------

- FIX: bcrypt is now installed into the Docker image, which allows
  passlib to work like it should (thanks @Diftraku, #224)

- MAINT: integration tests with ``twine`` have been updated to use the
  command-line interface rather than the internal API, which should
  make them more resilient over time (#226)

1.2.4 (2018-08-06)
------------------

- FIX: the command to download new versions of available packages now
  works with ``pip`` >= 10.0 (thanks @elboerto, #215)

1.2.3 (2018-08-04)
------------------

- MAINT: Remove broken downloads badge (thanks @hugovk, #209)

- ENH: Improved Dockerfile and ``docker-compose`` example, docs for using
  the docker image, automatic docker builds

------------------

  has shut down

- FIX: updated tests to use ``Popen`` rather than ``pip.main()`` given its
  removal in pip version 10.0

- DOC: scrubbed docs of links to pypi.python.org

- DEPRECATION: Drop support for Python 3.3 (thanks @hugovk, #198)

------------------

- FIX propagation of certain ``pypiserver`` settings via a ``paste.ini`` config
  file (thanks @luismsgomes, #156)

  (thanks @uSpike, #182)

- FIX resolved a regression preventing spinning up multiple pypiservers
  via a paste config (thanks @bertjwregeer, #173)

  and docs about ``auther``
  - (thanks to @sakurai-youhei, #162).

- Travis CI testing for Python 3.6 and pypy3 (#183)

- Several documentation improvements (thanks @tescalada, #166, #161, #172 and
  @axnsan12, #190)

1.2.0 (2016-06-25)
------------------
"Brexit": Normalize and stop legacy support.

- Less rigorous support for ``python-2 < 2.7`` and ``python-3 < 3.3``.
- Package normalizations and :pep:`503` updates:
  - Package names are normalized: convert all characters to lower-case
    and replace any of ``[-_.]`` with a dash(``'-'``).
  - The simple index only lists normalized package names.
  - Any request for a non-normalized package name is redirected to
    the normalized name.
  - URLs are redirected unless they end in ``'/'`` (expect packages themselves).
  - (thanks to @dpkp, #38, #139, #140)

- Added ``pip search`` support.
  - (thanks to @blade2005, #80, #114)

- FIX startup regressions for other WSGI-servers, introduced by previous ``v1.1.10``.

    #117, #122, #124/#127/#128)

- FIX over-writing of packages even when without ``--overwrite`` flag.
  - (thanks to @blade2005, #113)

- Fixes for *paste*, *gunicorn* and other *WSGI* servers.
  - (thanks to @corywright, @virtuald, @montefra, #112, #118, #119)

- Updates and fixes needed due to changes in dependent libraries.
  - (thanks @dpkp, #120/#121, #129, #141/#142)

- Add cache for speeding up GPG signatures.
  - sthanks to @virtuald, #116)

- Other minor fixes and improvements.
  - (thanks to @bibby, @Oneplus, @8u1a, #129, #131)

- TravisCI-test against *python-3.5*.
  - (#107, #108, #110)

- docs:

  - Provide samples for *Automated Startup* (``systemd`` & ``hypervisor``).
    (thanks to @ssbarnea, #137, #146)

  - Add usage instructions for related project ``pypi-uploader``.
    (thanks to @ssbarnea & @bibby, #147)

  - doc: Provide sample-code to authenticate using ``/etc/passwds`` file
    via *pam* modules in Unix.
    - (thanks to @blade2005, #149, #151-#153)

  - Improved API usage instructions.
  - Detailed changes recorded in `Github's milestone 1.2.0
    <https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/milestones/M1.2.0>`_.


1.1.10 (2016-01-19)
-------------------
Serve 1000s of packages, PGP-Sigs, skip versions starting with 'v'.

+ #101: Speed-up server by (optionally) using the `watchdog` package
  to cache results, serve packages directly from proxying-server (*Apache* ,
  *nginx*), and pre-compile regexes (thanks @virtuald).
- #106: Support uploading PGP-signatures (thanks @mplanchard).
- Package-versions parsing modifications:

  - #104: Stopped parsing invalid package-versions prefixed with `v`; they are
    invalid according to :pep-reference:`0440` (thanks @virtuald &
    @stevejefferiesIDBS).
  - Support versions with epochs separated by `!` like `package-1!1.1.0`.
  - #102: FIX regression on uploading packages with `+` char in their version
    caused by recent bottle-upgrade.
- #103: Minor doc fixes (thanks @MichaelSchneeberger).


1.1.9 (2015-12-21)
------------------
"Ssss-elections" bug-fix & maintenance release.

- Upgrade bottle 1.11.6-->1.13-dev.

  - Fixes `MAX_PARAM` limiting dependencies(#82)

- Rework main startup and standalone:

  - New standalone generation based on ZIPed wheel archive.
  - Replace all sys.module mechanics with relative imports.
  - Fix gevent monkeypatching (#49).
  - Simplify definition of config-options on startup.
  - TODO: Move startup-options validations out of `main()` and
    into `pypiserver.core`
    package, to validate also start-up from API-clients.

- #53: Like PyPI, HREF-links now contain package's md5-hashes in their fragment.
  Add `--hash_algo` cmd-line option to turn-off or specify other *hashlib*
  message-digest algorithms (e.g. `sha256` is a safer choice, set it to `off`
  to avoid any performance penalty if hosting a lot of packages).

- #97: Add `--auther` non cmd-line startup-option to allow for alternative
  authentication methods (non HtPasswdFile-based one) to be defined by
  API-clients (thanks @Tythos).

- #91: Attempt to fix register http failures (thanks to @Tythos and @petri).

  - Test actual clients (ie `pip`, `Twine`, `setuptools`).
  - Test spurious `setuptools` failures.
  - NOT FIXED!  Still getting spurious failures.

- Various other fixes:

  - #96: Fix program's requirement (i.e. add passlib as extra-requirement).
    provide requirements files also for developers.
  - logging: Send also bottle `_stderr` to logger; fix logger names.
  - #95: Add missing loop-terminators in bottle-templates (thanks to @bmflynn).
